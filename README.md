# Android Native Example App
An example Android app that demonstrates the use of C APIs inside an Android app.

## Note
This is neither meant to be a perfect example of C or Kotlin code, nor a perfect example of how to
integrate C libraries into an Android app. This is just to demonstrate what I have learned so far.
